### And now the boring stuff...

I am VP of Data Engineering & Analytics at [Verumex](https://engineering.verumex.com/), where I am leading 10+ very talented engineers in building a world class event-driven Cloud Data Platform around Snowflake, Sqitch, Power BI to enable real-time self-service analytics for Real Estate investors.

In December 2019, I co-founded my first company with a dear friend. At [**matchpoint.** (*innAIte technologies*)](https://matchpoint.innaite.tech/), we envisioned the future of professional :tennis: training and we tried to build it with the help of AI and Computer Vision.
